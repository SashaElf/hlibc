hlibc

DESCRIPTION:
------------

	hlibc is a freestanding libc that implements a subset of the POSIX, C99
	and C11 hosted implementation requirements. The mathematics library is
	a minimalistic fork of Sun fdlibm focused on IEEE-754-2008 floating
	point research and the study of fdlibm's core components.

	hlibc is targeted at the linux kernel's syscall ABI and currently
	supports the i386, x86_64, arm and aarch64 architectures.


BUILDING:
---------
	
	hlibc creates a wrapper for gcc or clang named "compiler" which
	redirects linking options allowing hlibc to be installed and used
	without root privilege.
