hlibc


	hlibc is a freestanding libc that implements a subset of the POSIX, C99
	and C11 hosted implementation requirements. The mathematics library is
	a minimalistic fork of Sun fdlibm focused on IEEE-754-2008 floating
	point research and the study of fdlibm's core components.

	hlibc is targeted at POSIX systems and works with the linux and FreeBSD
	kernels' syscall ABI. Currently i386, x86_64, arm and aarch64
	architectures are supported for linux and x86_64 is supported for 
	FreeBSD.

	hlibc focuses primarily on algorithmic correctness and effectiveness
	for the sake of educational purposes. Unlike many smaller libcs, hlibc
	has correct getc/putc semantics which are designed to eliminate short
	read and writes. These getc/putc semantics lie at the heart of the a
	libc's stdio and canonically define a majority of its usefulness.
	Indeed, no programming language has ever succeeded in completely
	replacing C's stdio functionalities with a shorter, more concise or
	more effective interface.

	Because hlibc does not need to be installed in order to be used it is
	well suited toward use in the classroom or as a tool for understanding 
	how more complex libc might work.

	The simplicity of hlibc allows for it to be easily ported to new
	operating systems.

	As much as possible, linux and glibc specific functionalities are
	excluded from hlibc. Instead, hlibc focuses on supplying functions which
	are described in the POSIX, C99 and C11 standards.


BUILDING:
---------
	
	hlibc creates a wrapper for gcc or clang named "compiler" which
	redirects linking options allowing hlibc to be installed and used
	without root privilege.


		git clone https://github.com/hlibc/hlibc

		cd hlibc
		./configure --prefix=/home/$USER/buildarea
		make
		make install

		/home/$USER/buildarea/bin/compiler hello.c


	If all went as expected then `compiler' will link against hlibc's
	libc.a and header files, completely excluding those of the host. Run
	`readelf -a' on the resulting binary and inspect the output to ensure
	that it was not contaminated by the host libc.


	Building on FreeBSD:

		pkg install gcc git

		git clone https://github.com/hlibc/hlibc

		cd hlibc
		CC=gcc ./configure --prefix=/home/$USER/buildarea
		gmake
		gmake install

	FreeBSD support is still experimental. Currently, only the gcc compiler
	wrapper is working correctly. Clang does work, but for whatever reason
	the compiler wrapper logic is broken. If you choose to use clang then
	the libc.a and the crt*.o files must be linked in by hand.
	

RELENG:
-------

	Release engineeering and versioning in hlibc is fully automated:

		make release

	Details can be found within tools/.release.


TESTING:
--------

	To download, build and run the hlibc-test test suite invoke:

		make test

	hlibc-test was split off from hlibc as it started to grow larger. It is
	retrieved automatically when `make test' is invoked. If for some reason
	you want it separately it can be downloaded from:

		https://github.com/hlibc/hlibc-test


WEB HOME:
---------

	hlibc does not currently have a web home. The instructions below
	are however valid and will be relevant when a new domain is obtained.

	The hlibc web home is a simple site which is automatically generated 
	from a shell script using the hlibc README so that the content is
	always up to date.

	A new index.html can be generated by running the tx2html script:

		./tools/.tx2html README
