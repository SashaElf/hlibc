hlibc

DESCRIPTION:
------------

	hlibc is a freestanding libc that implements a subset of the POSIX, C99
	and C11 hosted implementation requirements. The mathematics library is
	a minimalistic fork of Sun fdlibm focused on IEEE-754-2008 floating
	point research and the study of fdlibm's core components.

	hlibc is targeted at the linux kernel's syscall ABI and currently
	supports the i386, x86_64, arm and aarch64 architectures.


BUILDING:
---------
	
	hlibc creates a wrapper for gcc or clang named "compiler" which
	redirects linking options allowing hlibc to be installed and used
	without root privilege.


		git clone https://git.hlibc.xyz/lab/hlibc

		cd hlibc
		./configure --prefix=/home/$USER/buildarea
		make
		make install

		/home/$USER/buildarea/bin/compiler hello.c


	If all went as expected then `compiler' will link against hlibc's
	libc.a and header files, completely excluding those of the host. Run
	`readelf -a' on the resulting binary and inspect the output to ensure
	that it was not contaminated by the host libc.
	

TESTING:
--------

	To download, build and run the hlibc-test test suite invoke:

		make test
