Portions of this software are contributed or derived from software

all code included in musl follows below:

Most of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is
Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or
Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or
Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or

and labelled as such. All have been licensed under extremely
permissive terms. See the comments in the individual files for
details.

The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain. Several files (crt)
were released into the public domain; others are licensed under the
standard MIT license terms at the top of this file. See individual
files for their copyright status.

All files which have no copyright comments are original works
Copyright © 2005-2012 Rich Felker, the main author of this library.
The decision to exclude such comments is intentional, as it should be
possible to carry around the complete source code on tiny storage
media. All public header files (include/*) should be treated as Public
Domain as they intentionally contain no content which can be covered
by copyright. Some source modules may fall in this category as well.
If you believe that a file is so trivial that it should be in the
Public Domain, please contact me and, if I agree, I will explicitly
release it from copyright.

The following files are trivial, in my opinion not copyrightable in
the first place, and hereby explicitly released to the Public Domain:

All public headers: include/*
Startup files: crt/*
